Fast with delivery and easy to communicate with, and more importantly - he's great with receiving feedback and making the adjustments you need. With these qualities, our time on this project went by just as quick and smooth as one could hope for. Will definitely look to hire Shanesh again in the future.</p><div>- Hemanta Balami</div><cite>&nbsp;&nbsp; Managing Director</cite></div></li><li style="background-image: url(https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1341186261/pasfoto_pp_400x400.jpg);" class="face"><div class="bubble"><p>I have hired Shanesh twice now, and will go back to him with any other graphic design work I have.
